Linux-Cgroups
========================

setns is used to change the current namespace of the process by specifying a file descriptor to a currently available namespace.

So you must provide a file descriptor and a type (CLONE_ALL, CLONE_NEWIPC, CLONE_NEWNET, CLONE_NEWPID, CLONE_NEWUSER, CLONE_NEWUTS and CLONE_NEWCGROUP).

On successfull execution your process will now be in the desired namespace.
In case of failure, error message is printed to STDOUT.
